# Tab Killer 

![Tab Killer Icon](https://github.com/BorneLabs/Tab-Killer-ChromeExtension/blob/main/icon.png)

Tab Killer is a hilariously ruthless Chrome extension designed to "kill" tabs with a single click and keep track of your tab kill count. If you're someone who has 72 tabs open at any given moment but only uses 3, this is your comedic way out. It’s perfect for chaotic minimalists, digital hitmen, or just anyone who loves cleaning house (digitally speaking).

## Features
- **Kill Tabs:** Quickly close any tabs you’re no longer using.
- **Kill Count Tracker:** Tracks how many tabs you've "killed" so you can flex your tab-killing prowess.
- **Satisfying Sound Effects:** Because no kill is complete without sound.
- **Zero Guilt:** Unlike real-life decisions, this one is fun and reversible.
- **Psycho Penguin Icon:** A quirky penguin with a knife as your digital accomplice.
